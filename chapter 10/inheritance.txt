Inheritance is a way of creating a new class from an existing class.
class Emoloyee:	#Base Class
	#Code
class Programmer(Employee):	#Derived or child class
	#Code
Type of Inheritance
Single inheritance
Multiple inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Single Inheritance

Single inheritance occurs when a child class inherits only a single parent class.

Base -> Derived

Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritances occurs when the child class inherits from more than one parent class.
When a child class becomes a parent for another child class.
Super() method

Super method is used to access the methods of a superclass in the derived class.

super().__init__()  #Calls constructor of the base class
A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.

@classmethod decorator is used to create a class method.
@classmethod
def (cls, p1, p2):
	#code
class Employee:
	@property 
	def name(self):
		return self.ename
if e = Employee() is an object of class employee, we can print (e.name) top print the ename/call name() function

@name.setter
def name(self, value):
	self.ename = value
    Operator overloading in Python

Operators in python can be overloaded using dunder methods.

These methods are called when a given operator is used on the objects.

Operators in python can be overloaded using the following methods:

p1 + p2 -> p1.__add__(p2)

p1 â€“ p2 -> p1.__sub__(p2)

p1 * p2 -> p1.__mul__(p2)

p1 / p2 -> p1.__truediv__(p2)

p1 // p2 -> p1.__floordiv__(p2)
__str__() -> used  to set what gets displayed upon calling str(obj)

__len__() -> used to set what gets displayed upon calling .__len__() or len(obj)




so from all these we came to know a lot about all these python and all good things so that we can learn very well
in python it is a must to understand inheritance and all object oriented programming though i am learning it and aas well i
am not pro in python programming
