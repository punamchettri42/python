Inheritance
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. The benefits of inheritance are:

It represents real-world relationships well.
It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

# Python code to demonstrate how parent constructors
# are called.

# parent class
class Person(object):

	# __init__ is known as the constructor
	def __init__(self, name, idnumber):
		self.name = name
		self.idnumber = idnumber

	def display(self):
		print(self.name)
		print(self.idnumber)
		
	def details(self):
		print("My name is {}".format(self.name))
		print("IdNumber: {}".format(self.idnumber))
	
# child class
class Employee(Person):
	def __init__(self, name, idnumber, salary, post):
		self.salary = salary
		self.post = post

		# invoking the __init__ of the parent class
		Person.__init__(self, name, idnumber)
		
	def details(self):
		print("My name is {}".format(self.name))
		print("IdNumber: {}".format(self.idnumber))
		print("Post: {}".format(self.post))


# creation of an object variable or an instance
a = Employee('Rahul', 886012, 200000, "Intern")

# calling a function of the class Person using
# its instance
a.display()
a.details()
