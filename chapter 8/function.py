# Chapter 8 â€“ Functions and Recursions
# A function is a group of statements performing a specific task.

# When a program gets bigger in size and its complexity grows, it gets difficult for a programmer to keep track of which piece of code is doing what!

# A function can be reused by the programmer in a given program any number of times.
def func1():  #heere in python use of semicolon is almost zero and that : this is very important in python we use it in most casess
