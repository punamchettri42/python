#there are two loops in python
#they are >while loop and  >for loop
#while loop
''' while condition:
    #Body of the loop '''
''' 
so this is the condition of while loop  in while loop the condition is evaluated first if it comes true then only loop is evaluated
    '''
i = 0
while i<5:   #in python spacing is very important remember that
    print("punam")
    i = i+1
'''so this is the example of loop infact while loop here'''
