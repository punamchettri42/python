# Range function in Python
# The range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

# We can also specify the start, stop, and step-size as follows:

#             range(start, stop, step_size)

# step size is usually not used with range()
for i in range(0, 7):		#range(7) can also be used
	print(i)		#prints 0 to 6
